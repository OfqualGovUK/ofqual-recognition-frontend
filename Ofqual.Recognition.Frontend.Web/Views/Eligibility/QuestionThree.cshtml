                        We do not regulate courses that do not include an assessment of a learners attainment related to the specific knowledge, skills and behaviours.
                        <br /><br />
                        For example we do not regulate courses which are awarded based on attendance or number of hours completed.
                        <br /><br />
                        Your qualifications need to suitably assess the attainment of learners in order to be considered for regulation.
